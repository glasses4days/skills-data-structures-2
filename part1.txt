Recursion

1. In your own words, what is Recursion?
    Recursion is  when a function calls itself within said function.
2. Why is it necessary to have a Base Case?
    A base case is necessary to tell the function when to stop recursing. Else, 
    it will continue indefinitely. 

Graphs

1. What is a Graph?
    A graph is a data structure where vertices are connected via edges which can be 
    weighted. Graphs can also be directed and contain cycles. 
2. How is a Graph different from a Tree?
    A graph can contain loops while a tree cannot. Also edges can be weighted in a graph.
3. Give an example of somthing that would be good to model with a Graph.
    Something akin to facebook.

I started with the answers that I thought they were, but then checked them.
The first set was pretty on, but the second set, I was off with BST and trees

Sorting

1. Describe in words how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.
    Bubble sort is a sorting method that iterates over a list until the big numbers
    bubble to the top (end of the list.)
2. Describe in words how the Merge Sort algorithm works.
    Merge sort works by splitting lists into 1 item lists then compares two lists at a time 
    adding the lowest one to a new list until all items are added back sorted. Runs
    O(n log n)
3. Describe in words how the Quick Sort algorithm works.
    Quick sort uses a divide and conquer style by implementing a pivot that all other
    numbers in the list are compared to. This is all done in place. 

Git Branching

1. Give an instance when you would use git branching.
    When you want to try something new, but not sure how it will work. So you branch
    so that if it doesn't work out you don't have to delete it all out of your 
    initial code.
2. What is a pull request?
    It's how you contribute code to larger projects. You work on code in your own
    branch and then make the pull request to the owner of the repository who 
    can then choose to merge your branch or not.
